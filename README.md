## Hello!

I'm a Mechanical Engineering student by Major, but I've always been drawn to the mathematical underpinnings of any subject I'm interested in (that is, most subjects), so my real academic specialty is in the realm of classical physics and dynamics. Over time, I've built up a small but growing library of physics simulations and I figure that here's a good place to show them off (I'd highly recommend checking out `WheelsWithinWheels.m`).

Though that isn't the principal repository on this site. Long before I realized just how mathematically painful 3D rolling is, I stumbled into a math problem so vast and infuriatingly fascinating that the better part of three years' worth of free time has not been enough to get better than a vague outline of what the solution might look like. Stated simply, the goal is to find all the equilibrium distributions of *n* electrons on a sphere, the main frustration, also stated simply, being that the vast majority of those distributions are unstable. Lucky for you, only I have to worry about all the difficulties of solving the problem; you get to just explore all the fun visualization programs I've developed to get a handle on it.

### Thanks for stopping by!
